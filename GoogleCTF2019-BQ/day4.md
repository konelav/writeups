STOP GAN (**pwn**)

    Success, you've gotten the picture of your lost love, not knowing 
    that pictures and the things you take pictures of are generally two 
    seperate things, you think you've rescue them and their brethren by 
    downloading them all to your ships hard drive. They're still being 
    eaten, but this is a fact that has escaped you entirely. Your 
    thoughts swiftly shift to revenge. It's important now to stop this 
    program from destroying these "Cauliflowers" as they're referred 
    to, ever again.
