Beginner's Quest

    Welcome to the Beginner's Quest! A few notes before your embark:
      - There are multiple paths that lead through different challenges,
        to 4 different endings.
      - Only after solving the most difficult challenges do you receive
        the "winning" ending.
      - Save your flags in case you want to try different branches
        later, after reaching an ending.
      - Three challenges have two flags, each taking you towards a
        different path.
      - See the map for an overview of the challenges and paths.
      - Problems vary in both difficulty and time to solve (ie. some
        might be easier but take more time to do the work for the flag.)
        You can go back to make different choices if you don't like what
        is ahead.
