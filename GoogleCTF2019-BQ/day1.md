Arrival & Reconnaissance


    Having successfully figured out this "coordinate" problem. The ship 
    lurches forward violently into space. This is one of the moments 
    when you realize that some kind of thought or plan would have been 
    good, but typically for you and how you found yourself in this 
    situation, you didn't think too much before acting. Only the stars 
    themselves know where you'll end up.

    After what seems like an eternity, or at least one full season of 
    "Xenon's Next Top Galactic Overlord" you arrive in a system of 9 
    planetary bodies, though one of them is exceptionally small. You 
    nostalgically remember playing explodatoid with your friends and 
    hunting down planets like this. But this small planet registers a 
    hive of noise and activity on your ships automated scanners. 
    There's things there! Billions upon trillions of things, moving 
    around, flying, swimming, sliding, falling.

    Of particular interest may be the insect-like creatures flying 
    around this planet, uniformly. One has the words "Osmium 
    Satellites" written on it. Maybe this is a starting point to get to 
    know what's ahead of you.


We can choose not to inspect Osmium immidiately. In this case there 
will be an additional task.

Looking short video it can be seen that there are many fast-changing 
scenes, so just download it and look locally frame-by-frame.

    $ ffmpeg -i y2mate.mp4 frame%03d.jpg -hide_banner

And in the `frame438.jpg` we can see it.

Satellite (**networking**)

    Placing your ship in range of the Osmiums, you begin to receive 
    signals. Hoping that you are not detected, because it's too late 
    now, you figure that it may be worth finding out what these signals 
    mean and what information might be "borrowed" from them. Can you 
    hear me Captain Tim? Floating in your tin can there? Your tin can 
    has a wire to ground control? Find something to do that isn't 
    staring at the Blue Planet.

In archive we have two files - `README.pdf` and `init_sat`.
The curse of my is an abscence of habit to really truly read README 
files before taking any further actions. To be precise, I read the 
file, but did not look on picture. Though it is not very important.

Ok, let's run `init_sat`. It requests some *satellite name*...
How can we know it? Well, the easy path is to carefully read README.pdf 
and realize that there is sign on the satellite's photo.
But for me it is very hard path because of said above.
So disasming gives the answer either.

Wow, I'm glad that there is no need to reverse all this application!
Really, there are A LOT of different stuff, including networking, 
of course.
We can see now that for jumping over "Unrecognized satellite" we must 
enter string "osmium". And check is case insensitive - this fact can't 
be seen from README.pdf! Let's use it, just for not feeling myself so 
stupid.

This is obviously base64-encoded data (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, +, / and = for 
padding). Decode it:

    $ echo "VXNlcm5hbWU6IHdpcmVzaGFyay1yb2NrcwpQYXNzd29yZDogc3RhcnQtc25pZmZpbmchCg==" | python -m base64 -d -
    Username: wireshark-rocks
    Password: start-sniffing!

Okay, let's sniff `init_sat`'s traffic. Wireshark certainly rocks, 
but there are other good tools and I'm trying to leave command line 
as rare as possible.

First, open another shell and see what connections `init_sat` has.

    $ netstat -tnpa | grep init_sat
    tcp        0      0 10.137.5.22:41228       34.76.101.29:1337       ESTABLISHED 20996/./init_sat    

Second, start to sniff filtering by port number.

    $ sudo tcpdump -nA port 1337
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

Then return to `init_sat` and hit (a) again. We see some traffic:

    ....

I believe that password is substituted for asterisks by `init_sat` 
itself. There are a lot of stuff about regular expressions in it as 
well as a string `CTF{\S{40}}` (and how would I know this if looked 
README's photo?).
Doing data protection on client-side is a Great Evil, so let's try to 
solve this problem in completely another way, not like "networking", 
but like "pwn" problem.
