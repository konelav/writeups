Arrival & Reconnaissance


    Having successfully figured out this "coordinate" problem. The ship 
    lurches forward violently into space. This is one of the moments 
    when you realize that some kind of thought or plan would have been 
    good, but typically for you and how you found yourself in this 
    situation, you didn't think too much before acting. Only the stars 
    themselves know where you'll end up.

    After what seems like an eternity, or at least one full season of 
    "Xenon's Next Top Galactic Overlord" you arrive in a system of 9 
    planetary bodies, though one of them is exceptionally small. You 
    nostalgically remember playing explodatoid with your friends and 
    hunting down planets like this. But this small planet registers a 
    hive of noise and activity on your ships automated scanners. 
    There's things there! Billions upon trillions of things, moving 
    around, flying, swimming, sliding, falling.

    Of particular interest may be the insect-like creatures flying 
    around this planet, uniformly. One has the words "Osmium 
    Satellites" written on it. Maybe this is a starting point to get to 
    know what's ahead of you.


We can choose not to inspect Osmium immidiately. In this case there 
will be an additional task.

Looking short video it can be seen that there are many fast-changing 
scenes, so just download it and look locally frame-by-frame.

    $ ffmpeg -i y2mate.mp4 frame%03d.jpg -hide_banner

And in the `frame438.jpg` we can see it.
